## Docker
### 1. Basic docker containers and commands:
```sh
docker run --name hellWorld hello-world  // this will download hello-world image from remote registry of dockerhub and runs the container.
```
> Note: <br />
> -the `run` in above command creates new container and runs the container.<br />
> -if no process running in the container, the container will get terminated immediately.<br />
> -the flag `--name hellWorld` is used to give a name to the container. If we don't provide a name to the container, a random name is assigned to the container.<br />
> -it is not possible to create two container with same name.<br />
---
```sh
docker pull alpine // this will only download the image
```
---
```sh
docker ps // shows all running containers
```
> -`docker container ls` is an alternative command to `docker ps` <br />
> -`docker ps` commands shows containerid, container name, port and the command that's immediately executed inside the container. <br />

---
```sh
docker ps -a  // shows all past executed containers and their shell
```
---
```sh
docker stop D7 //  stops the running contailner, put only two chars of containerID
```
> Note: we can put container name also instead of container id. All running container info is shown by using `docker ps` command. <br />
---

```sh
docker run -it ubuntu // enters bash shell of ubuntu. Enter exit to exit the bash shell.
```
---

```sh
docker images // shows all downloaded images with its size.
```
---
```sh
docker exec ubuntu1 echo "hello world" // this will execute echo command inside ubuntu1 container
```
---
```sh
docker exec -it ubuntu1 bash // with this command we can enter ubuntu1 containers bash shell in interactive mode
```
---
### 2. Volume mapping and port mapping:

```sh
docker run nginx // runs nginx container with port 80 opened
```
---
```sh
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx
```
> -here with `-p 8080:80` we have opened port 8080 of the system and mapped it with container's port 80. <br />
> -all request to port 8080 is forwarded to port 80 of the container.<br />
> -now localhost:8080 will work. <br />
---
```sh
docker run -p 8080:80 -v /Users/vikasnaikmacbkpro/CodeWorkspace/Nginx:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
```
> -here `/Users/vikasnaikmacbkpro/CodeWorkspace/Nginx` is local system directory path and `/usr/share/nginx/html` is container's directory path.

### 3. Container Management:

```sh
docker run -p 8080:80 -d nginx // runs the container in the background
```
> -the `-d` flag in above command runs the container in the background and all the logs are stored to review it later. <br />
> -above command will return the SHA Hashcode and run the container in background. <br />
> -we can use command `docker log 922590` to view log of container running in the background. <br />
---

```sh
docker log 922590 // shows log of the container having id 922590, put only first few chars of the containerid running in the background.
```

---
```sh
docker run --name ubuntu1 ubuntu // 
```
> Note: 
> -with above command we can create multiple container from same image. <br />
> -all containers will have different environment with diff file structure but will share   same DOCKER HOST resources among them. <br />
> -all containers will have different ip address but will be in same network as of network bridge of local system (DOCKERHOST). <br />

---
```sh
docker start ubuntu1 // start the existing container which was stopped in the past
```
> -the `start` in above command is used to start the existing container which is currently not running. <br />
> -`ubuntu1` in above command is the container name that we want to start. <br />
> -with `docker start` command container will be started exactly with the same configuration as it was running with before exit.(ie port mapping, volume mapping, container name) <br />
---

```sh
docker rm ubuntu1 // delete the existing container with name ubuntu1
```

---
```sh
docker container prune  // deletes all stopped containers
```

---
```sh
docker container rm 05 d7 // deletes two stopped containers having containerids starting with 05 and d7
```

---

### 4.A. Node.js in Docker:
```sh
docker pull node // downloads nodejs image
```

---
```sh
docker run -it node  // create new container from node image in interactive mode
```

---
```sh
docker run -v $PWD:/app -w /app node node hello.js
```
>Note: <br />
   -in above command we have mapped our local system current directory with node containers `/app` directory. <br />
   -the `-w /app` indicates that we want to set `/app` directory of container as a working directory. <br />
   -the first `node` in the command is the name of the image. <br />
   -after the first node, every thing ie `node hello.js` is the command to be executed inside the container.  <br />
---

### 4.B. Express.js in Docker:

```sh
docker run -v $PWD:/app -w /app -it node npm init 
```
>Note: <br />
   -above command will create package.jon file in /app directory of container but bcoz it mapped to our local directory, we can see this file in our local system directory. <br />
   

---
```sh
docker run -v $PWD:/app -w /app -it node npm install express
```
>Note: <br />
   -above command will install expressjs module.

---

```sh
docker run -v $PWD:/app -w /app -it -p 8081:3000 node node index.js
```
>Note: <br />
   -above command will map local system port 8081 with containers expressjs port 3000. <br />
   -the node.js is an expressjs application.
---
> to handle control C (^c) to terminate the expressjs server application, write below lines of code in the expressjs application server. 

```javascript
const process = require('process')
process.on('SIGINT',() => {
   console.log('Application is being interrupted...')
   process.exit(0)
})
```

> to terminate the express server when we stop the container write below line of code

```javascript
const process = require('process')
process.on('SIGTERM',() => {
   console.log('Application is being terminated...')
   process.exit(0)
})
```
